        "extendedDesc": "After finishing my studies at #ArgentinaPrograma, a program made to form new web developers (more info about it in Argentina Programa's project), I was already looking for new opportunities and new ways to push myself a bit further with new challenges, and sooner than later, a relatively new HR consultory contacted me to create a web app that can be used by all kind of people, oriented for small, local buisness. As a recently graduated web developer, I thought that the knowledge I had, was enough to make an easy going project. But I was wrong.",
        "extendedDesc2": "The project itself is a simple home page, with all the information and services offered by the consultory, every service has it's own page for the customer to request the service easly, by sending a pre-configured email to the consultory.",
        "extendedDesc3": "Working side by side with a client means that you have to be prepared for the unexpected, be ready to change things on any moment, and overall, be very flexible. Since the project itself wasn't that hard, it thaught me to be way more concious about other things, not only code. To be more comprehensive with non-technical people, in order to explain them how web development works, and translate their requirements from non-technical language to technical language. And also to suggest better ideas for the project, in order to improuve the final product.",
        "extendedDesc4": "This project thaught me to never underestimate a new challenge, and how to work with a customer in general terms, it was a great experience.",

Being possible to make CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with most of the information available there. It was a whole new challenge for me, since I didn't even knew most of the technologies we used there, being my first aproach to Angular, MySQL, Java, and Spring Boot, among others. The project works fine, but it takes a few moments to load the information, since we had to use free hosting services for everything. it was my first experience using hosting services and working on a real backend project.",
