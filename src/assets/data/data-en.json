It is the result of continuous improvement, exploring new design approaches, and seeking optimal solutions. The design adopts a minimalistic yet effective approach, prioritizing mobile-first principles and user-friendly interactions to ensure a seamless browsing experience. I strive to provide the best possible user experience, and this portfolio is a testament to my ongoing commitment to excellence in web development.",
        "extendedDesc2": "Some of the challenges I've found in this project were easy to overcome, while others took me a few days to solve. The main challenge was to keep the app responsive and attractive for all screen sizes, from small mobile to large screens. In this project I've learned to work more effectively and quickly, and it was also the first one I did with the 'mobile-first' philosophy applied. As a result, I was able to create a product that successfully adapts to any device, while maintaining the balance and integrity without compromising functionality and esthetics.",

        "extendedDesc3": "Working side by side with a client means that you have to be prepared for the unexpected, be ready to change things on any moment, and overall, be very flexible. Since the project itself wasn't that hard on the code level, it was at an interpersonal level, since it thaught me to be way more concious about other things, not only code. It taught me to be more comprehensive with non-technical people, in order to explain them how web development works, and translate their requirements from non-technical language to technical language. And also to suggest better ideas for the project, in order to improuve the final product. Once the project was finished, it generated an increase on the customer's visibility, profesionalism, and overall better performance for the buisness.",

It was a whole new challenge for me, since I didn't even knew most of the technologies we used there, being my first aproach to Angular, MySQL, Java, and Spring Boot, among others. The project works fine, but it takes a few moments to load the information, since we had to use free hosting services for everything. it was my first experience using hosting services and working on a real backend project.",
